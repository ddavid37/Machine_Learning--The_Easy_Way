    "question": "Estimate the selling price of a house based on square footage and location. What type of ML task is this?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Regression",
      "B": "Classification"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "This is a regression task because you're predicting a continuous numerical value (selling price). Regression models handle continuous outputs; classification is for discrete categories."

    "question": "A bank wants to predict loan default risk and explain decisions clearly to clients. Which model fits best?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Decision Tree",
      "B": "Neural Network",
      "C": "Support Vector Machine"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Decision Trees are ideal for interpretability â€” they offer clear, human-readable rules. Neural Networks and SVMs are harder to explain to non-technical users."

    "id": "q3",
    "question": "You need to classify emails as spam or not, instantly, at scale. Which model should you choose?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Logistic Regression",
      "B": "k-Nearest Neighbors",
      "C": "Decision Tree"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Logistic Regression is lightweight, fast, and works well for binary classification tasks like spam detection, especially with large, high-dimensional data."

    "question": "Which type of machine learning involves learning patterns from labeled training data?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Unsupervised Learning",
      "B": "Supervised Learning",
      "C": "Reinforcement Learning"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Supervised Learning uses labeled examples to train models. Each input has a known output, helping the model learn mappings."

    "id": "q5",
    "question": "What technique would you use for customer segmentation based on purchasing patterns?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)",
      "B": "Classification (Supervised Learning)",
      "C": "Reinforcement Learning"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Clustering (unsupervised learning) groups customers into segments without pre-labeled categories, making it ideal for discovering hidden patterns."
